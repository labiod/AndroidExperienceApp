# AndroidExperienceApp
    This app contains everything I know about implementing, testing and releasing app on android devices

## Tags meaning
    Release tag looks like 0.0.0 where the most important value means year, second month
    and the last is the release number in current month
    So for example:
        0.2.1 - means that my experience in android equals two months and there was only one release in last month
        1.2.3 - experience equals 1 year and 2 months and in the last month there were 3 releases

## Current TAG - 0.0.1
    I have 5-6 years experience in android development but the idea for this app came up right now.
    So I must complete the previous years. But first things first.

## TAG 0.0.1
    - Initial version, create application using Android studio.
    - Api version 4.0
    - use fragment in Activity
    - use android support library

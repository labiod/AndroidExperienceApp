# AndroidExperienceApp
    this app contains all of I know about implement, testing and releasing app on android devices

## Idea of project 
    Create component library, base on what I learn in last yars
## Tags meaning
    Releas tag looks like 0.0.0 where the most important value means year, second month
    and the last is the release number in current month
    So for example:
        0.2.1 - means that my experience in android equals two months and was only one release in last month
        1.2.3 - experience equals 1 year and 2 months and in the last month was 3 release

## Current TAG - 0.0.3
    I have 5-6 years experience in android development but the idea for this app came up right now.
    So I must complete the previous years. But first thinks first.
